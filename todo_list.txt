(A) ===== Game-extraction related tasks =====

1a. Document in-game meaning of all entries from '*.cif' / '*.ini' files responsible for maps content.
    (Some possible entries might not be present anywhere, all of them probably are stored as strings in *.exe file.)
    Categories of entries necessary to document:
        - animals                           - buildings
        - units (+ jobs)                    - tribes
        - mission results                   - mission goals
        - 'Control' parameters              - ai conditions and actions
        - remaining 'StartUp' parameters    - remaining 'Mission' parameters
        *- all remaining useful information not mentioned here

2a. (Bonus Task) Try to find version of Cultures released before 22nd August 2000 (for checking landscapes BaseArea and
    ExtendedArea values from later modified landscapes.)-> This is not a programming challenge, but a research-like one.



(B) ===== Repository related tasks =====

1b. Write proper README.md file for github repository.
2b. Write additional comments in code as a form of documentation.
3b. If necessary, write '*.tex' file with technical documentation that would be too broad for comments in code.
4b. Decide which licence we want to use after making repo public.



(C) ===== Editor related tasks =====

1c. Turn all previously written code into nicely portable package. (It might be very useful to use instead of file input
    and output some objects of type 'bytes' so it wouldn't be necessary to save and immediately load some data).
    This point might be relevant if we want to separate editor-related code from direct-map-edition code.

2c. Decide on engine/library to write a fully functional editor. (This engine must support packages import from python
    to make it compatible with already exisiting code). Proposition: OpenGL + Pygame

3c. Program following features regarding pseudo-3D graphics render:
    - Displaying units/animals based on '*.bmd', '*.pcx' and '*.cif'/'*.ini' files.
    - Displaying terrain patterns based on patterndefs_normal.ini file and 'data_v\ve_graphics\textures1' folder.
        - 'APixelCoords' and 'BPixelCoords' are responsible for determining triangle texture corners for display.
        - 'Transition' and 'TransitionDef' sections are responsible for determining corners of thin rhombuses which are
          meant to be drawn on edges between triangles in six possible configurations
          (hence 36 values - 3 corners of trianges on 2d plane each in 6 possible configuations).
    - Displaying overlay textures for 'mstr' section (road / water / snow)
    - Stretching terrain and overlay texutres to be displayed accordingly to heightmap.
    - Changing perspective and zooming in/out as in game with camera.

4c. Write function that would convert building-related landscapes into plain text with proper '*.ini' syntax containing
    same buildings but stored as 'real' buildings not as landscapes. This way it won't be necessary to program editing
    buildings on its own for '*.ini' files.

5c. Write function that would generate heightmap and terrain based on generic image similar to those present in
    'Editor/Premaps' folder in newer Cultures games.

(D) ===== The end =====

1d. Use created tools to make actuall Cultures 1 Fan-Made map :)
