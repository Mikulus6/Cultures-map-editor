User interface:
    - modify terrain triangles with automatic transitions - smooth triangular border (based on data from ve_edit)
    - implement undo button + redo button
    - add keyboard shortcuts (ctrl+N, ctrl+O, ctrl+S, ctrl+shift+S, ctr+Z, ctr+Y) -> (new, open, save, save as, undo, redo)
    - load terrain & height template from image (applying pcx to existing empty map)
    - add hash validation to cache.bin
    - add loading visuals if speeding loading cache.bin is not possible
    - make shifting perspective possible
    - move camera by using third mouse wheel button

    - speed up bmd loading process to make cache.bin unnecessary if possible
    - speed up map saving algorithm (all derivations together are slow)
    - speed up map display if possible

Scripts documentation:
    - describe in pdf: animalis, buildings, units (jobs), tribes
    - describe in pdf: missions (goals, results, etc.)
    - describe in pdf: AI conditions and actions
    - describe in pdf: control & startup parameters (and all remaining information)
    - portable cif - ini converter and lib extractor and archiver (either incorporated in editor or as a separated exe)
    - write a pdf with techincal documentation (referece: bmd format.pdf file)
    - write a pdf with map-making tutorial & pipeline (referece: existing Polish & German tutorials for 8th wonder)
    - clean up code and add comments where it's necessary
    - write markdown readme for GitHub repository
    - decide which licence we want to use after making repo public

After finishing everything make an actuall fan-made Cultures 1 map :)
