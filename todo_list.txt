
1. Find derivation algorithm of 'mgfs' 0th, 1st and 2nd layers (from 'mhei' + 'mepa' + 'mepb' + 'mgfs' 7th layer)
    - These three bitwise layers correspond to three directions of edges.

2. Create interpolation algorithm that for given 'mepa' + 'mepb' pair of sections would fix as many transition triangles
   as possible to make terrain look smooth as in original maps.

3. Try to find version of Cultures released before 22nd August 2000 (for checking landscapes BaseArea and ExtendedArea
   values from later modified landscapes.)
    - This is not a programming challenge, but a research-like one.

4. Document in-game meaning of all entries from '*.cif' / '*.ini' files responsible for maps content.
    - Some possible entries might not be present anywhere, all of them probably are stored as strings in *.exe file.
