1. When saving 'mepa'+'mepb' instead of using red and green channels for Id+SetId use exactly the same colors as in-game
   minimap would do. For cases when two types of terrain use exactly the same color, decide manually which one should
   differ.
   - Test in-game which colors are used by which terrain types on perfectly flat terrain with correct light.
   - There are 359 patterns defined, so 256-colors pcx dictionary is not a solution.
   - Create a json file with dictionary for that.

2. Similarly to map.save_to_data and map.load_from_data create two functions named maybe "save_to_primary_data" and
   "load_from_primary_data" (or maybe rename old methods to something like "save_to_raw_data" etc.)
   The point is: user should be albe to load and save map using only primary sections.
   Those are: 'mhei', 'mepa', 'mepb', 'llan'.

3. Create interpolation algorithm that for given 'mepa' + 'mepb' pair of sections would fix as many transition triangles
   as possible to make terrain look smooth as in original maps.

4. Try to find version of Cultures released before 22nd August 2000 (for checking landscapes BaseArea and ExtendedArea
   values from later modified landscapes.)
    - This is not a programming challenge, but a research-like one.

5. Document in-game meaning of all entries from '*.cif' / '*.ini' files responsible for maps content.
    - Some possible entries might not be present anywhere, all of them probably are stored as strings in *.exe file.
