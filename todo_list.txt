
1. Find derivation algorithm of 'mgfs' 0th, 1st and 2nd layers (from 'mhei' + 'mepa' + 'mepb' + 'mgfs' 7th layer)
    - These three bitwise layers correspond to three directions of edges.

2. Find in-game meaning and derivation algorithm for 'smmw' subsection in 'xsec' section.
    - There is only one bit with unknown meaning.

3. Create interpolation algorithm that for given 'mepa' + 'mepb' pair of sections would fix as many transition triangles
   as possible to make terrain look smooth as in original maps.

4. Try to find version of Cultures released before 22nd August 2000 (for checking landscapes BaseArea and ExtendedArea
   values from later modified landscapes.)
    - This is not a programming challenge, but a research-like one.

5. Write a function that would update '*.map' file based on '*.sav' file.
    - Offset of sections revelant to map files has to be calculated correcty. Finding reversed strings of headers just
      by pure phrase-finding is not acceptable due to possible duplications in actual data.
    - This point is not necessary.

6. Document in-game meaning of all entries from '*.cif' / '*.ini' files responsible for maps content.
    - Some possible entries might not be present anywhere, all of them probably are stored as strings in *.exe file.
