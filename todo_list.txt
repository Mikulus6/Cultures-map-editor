User interface:
    - scrollable list with tiles (terrain, landscapes, structures)
    - buttons with edit options (terrain, height, landscapes, structures)
    - add map margin (when resizeing and editing)
    - fill selected area with chosen landscape (custom density)
    - modify height of selected area (increase, decrease, randomize, average)
    - modify terrain triangles (one type, set of multiple types with random frequency)
    - button: mark X-Y-Radius area (tkinter input)
    - load terrain & height template from image (applying pcx to existing empty map)

    - function for smoothening border between different types of terrain (e.g. water and beach)
    - choose and fill terrain according to data in ve_edit directory
    - choose and fill landscapes according to data in ve_edit directory

    - speed up bmd loading process to make cache.bin unnecessary
    - add loading visuals if speeding loading cache.bin is not possible
    - speed up map saving algorithm (all derivations together are slow)
    - speed up map display if possible (show mstr when camera is in motion if possible)
    - make shifting perspective possible
    - move camera by using mouse wheel button

Scripts documentation:
    - describe in pdf: animalis, buildings, units (jobs), tribes
    - describe in pdf: missions (goals, results, etc.)
    - describe in pdf: AI conditions and actions
    - describe in pdf: control & startup parameters (and all remaining information)
    - portable cif - ini converter and lib extractor and archiver (either incorporated in editor or as a separated exe)
    - write a pdf with techincal documentation (referece: bmd format.pdf file)
    - write a pdf with map-making tutorial & pipeline (referece: existing Polish & German tutorials for 8th wonder)
    - clean up code and add comments where it's necessary
    - write markdown readme for GitHub repository
    - decide which licence we want to use after making repo public

After finishing everything make an actuall fan-made Cultures 1 map :)
