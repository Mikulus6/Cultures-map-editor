
1. Find derivation algorithm of 'mgfs' 0th, 1st and 2nd layers (from 'mhei' + 'mepa' + 'mepb' + 'mgfs' 7th layer)
    - These three bitwise layers might correspond to three directions of edges, however this is not confirmed.

2. Find in-game meaning of 'mstr' values (which ones represent snow, water, road)
    - In worst-case scenario it might be necessary to check all 65536 values by hand.
    - These seem to be bitwise flags

3. Find in-game meaning of remaining unknown value of unsigned byte variable in 'xsec' section
    - These seem to be roughly related to land area near walk sector points.

4. Find derivation algorithm for placement of 'walk sector points' in 'xsec' section
    - I suspect this might be something like hexagonally-shaped snail.
    - Walk sector point cannot be placed on water or void.

5. Find in-game meaning and derivation algorithm for 'smmw' subsection in 'xsec' section.

6. Try to find version of Cultures released before 22nd August 2000 (for checking landscapes BaseArea and ExtendedArea
   values from later modified landscapes.)
    - This is not a programming challenge, but a research-like one.

7. Write a function that would update '*.map' file based on '*.sav' file.
    - Offset of sections revelant to map files has to be calculated correcty. Finding reversed strings of headers just
      by pure phrase-finding is not acceptable due to possible duplications in actual data.

8. Document in-game meaning of all entries from '*.cif' / '*.ini' files responsible for maps content.
    - Some possible entries might not be present anywhere, all of them probably are stored as strings in *.exe file.

9. Create interpolation algorithm that for given 'mepa' + 'mepb' pair of sections would fix as many transition triangles
   as possible to make terrain look smooth as in original maps.
