# Documentation

## Introduction

Main application `Editor.exe` present in [*releases section*](https://github.com/Mikulus6/Cultures-map-editor/releases)
provides functionalities necessary to view and modify `*.map` files. This is
enough to freely manipulate terrain, heightmap, landscapes and structures but
not enough to create a fully playable map in game on its own. For this, one
has to construct additional text and image files which, combined with `*.map`
file, can contribute to playable content. These are `*.cif`, `*.pcx` and
`.txt` files. The following documentation is meant to explain how these
additional files are constructed and how to properly modify them.

There are required third-party programs meant for modifying those
files. These are listed below. User is expected to have them installed
alongside `Converters.exe` supplement provided in [*releases section*](https://github.com/Mikulus6/Cultures-map-editor/releases).
Default text and image editors present on commonly known operating systems
might not have enough functionalities, as it might be necessary to manually
change text encoding and to modify a bitmap with indexed colormap.

Each fully functional map consists of at least five files: `*.cif`,
`*txt.cif`, `*.map`, `*.pcx` and `*.txt`. Additionally, there could be
multiple other `*.pcx` and `*.fnt` files included in map files structure. For
basic ideas standing behind these files one is expected to look up on their
own how they are structured inside `data_m` directory in game's main directory
for maps already present in game. If such directory is absent, it is necessary
to extract it from `data_l\data_m.lib` accordingly to documentation specific
for `*.lib` file format. Note that `*.cif` file format is bidirectionally
interchangeable with plain text `*.ini` format, what is further described
in documentations specific for `*.cif` and `*.ini` file formats.
