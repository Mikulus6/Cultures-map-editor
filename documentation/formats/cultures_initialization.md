## Cultures initialization file `(*.cif)`

### Introduction

Cultures initialization file `(*.cif)` is a file format used by *Cultures*,
meant for storing textual data. Content of this file format is protected by
cipher. Breaking it makes it possible to losslessly convert this type of file
to plain text stored as a `*.ini` file. Applying this cipher to a decrypted
file also makes it possible to losslessly convert it back to original file
format. In short, this means `*.cif` and `*.ini` file formats are
bidirectionally interchangeable.

Using `Converters.exe` application provided in [*releases section*](https://github.com/Mikulus6/Cultures-map-editor/releases)
one can freely decrypt `*.cif` files or encrypt `*.ini` files. Historically,
[*cif2txt.exe*](https://web.archive.org/web/20210724220815/https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=3711)
was used to partially perform these conversions and had further backward
compatibility for old operating systems, but it is neither recommended nor
easily available online anymore.

### Inclusion priority

Game tries to read multiple `*.cif` files upon being opened. If the desired
file cannot be found, as a failsafe, game tries to load file with the same
path and the same name except with `*.ini` file format. Upon loading such
file, it will be automatically converted to `*.cif` file by game and saved
under the initially searched path and name.

It is not recommended to leave both `*.cif` and `*.ini` files with the same
name in the same directory, as this might lead to inconsistent priority when
it comes to loading those files by the game.

Take for example the file `game.cif` present in game's main directory. Upon
game initialization there will be performed the following searches of this
file:
1. Find `game.cif`. If present, load it with the decoded cipher and end the
   search. Otherwise, go to the next point.
2. Find `game.ini`. Load it. Apply the cipher to the loaded file and save it
   as `game.cif`.

Note that capitalization of paths and names is not important.

### File format

For the algorithm used by the provided tools, one can look into Python file
[*supplements/initialization.py*](../../supplements/initialization.py) present
in this repository. Cipher present in `*.cif` files uses an
[ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII)-based
[Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) combined with
[XOR cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_cipher). This cipher was
first broken by bacter and documented on
[XeNTaX forum](https://web.archive.org/web/20210724220815/https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=3711).
Keep in mind, the exact specifications of this algorithm are the same only for
*Cultures: Discovery of Vinland*, *Cultures: The Revenge of the Rain God* and
*Cultures Gold*. There is another slightly different version of this file
format used in *Cultures 2: The Gates of Asgard* and in most of newer games
released as part of the *Cultures* series.
