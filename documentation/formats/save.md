## Save file (`*.sav`)

### Introduction

Save files are used to store the state of already started gameplay. This is the
most complex file format exclusive to *Cultures*. Binary structure of save
files is not yet fully understood, but it resembles [`*.map`](map.md) file
format in many aspects. Every save file can be loaded into the version of the
game on which it was created.

Keep in mind, the exact specifications of save files
binary structure are the same only for *Cultures: Discovery of Vinland*,
*Cultures: The Revenge of the Rain God* and *Cultures Gold*. There is a
different version of this file format used in *Cultures 2: The Gates of
Asgard* and in most of the newer games released as part of the *Cultures*
series.

### Usages

Using `Converters.exe` application provided in [releases section](https://github.com/Mikulus6/Cultures-map-editor/releases)
one can import `*.map` file contained within `*.sav` file.

Using additional external tools ([*PC: Cheats für Cultures - Die Entdeckung Vinlands*](https://www.mogelpower.de/cheats/Cultures-Die-Entdeckung_PC_8556.html))
one can partially modify content of a save file, thereby altering the course
of gameplay.
