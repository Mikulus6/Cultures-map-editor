## Cursor file (`*.cur`)

### Description

images on Windows operating system. More specific documentation can be found
in [ISO Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICO_(file_format))
(as `*.ico` and `*.cur` file formats are almost identical, hence they share a
common documentation). This file format can be opened and modified with [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/).
