## Cursor file (`*.cur`)

### Description

Cursor file is a common file format used to store information about cursor
images on the Windows operating system. More specific documentation can be
found in the [ICO Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICO_(file_format))
(because the `*.ico` and `*.cur` file formats are almost identical, they share
common documentation). This file format can be opened and modified with [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/).
In *Cultures* this file format is used to store images of the hardware cursor.
